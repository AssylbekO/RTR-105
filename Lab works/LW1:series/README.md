Labaratory work â„–17

Assigned fucntion was the "bessel fucntion" with such expression:

I calculated the reccurence factor:

The code is working properly accomplishing all of the required tasks:

The code includes:

1) ASCII drawings
2) Expression of reccurence factor of Taylor series (as well as ASCII drawing of it)
3) Dialogue with a user to obtain value of "x"
4) Value of penultimate term
5) Value of last term
6) Calculate and show the value of function besj0(x)
7) As well as calculating and demostrating the value of the same fucntion, using Taylor series.
 
Here is an example of how the code looks like if x = 3:
