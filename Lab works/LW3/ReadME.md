Lab work â„–3:

Numerical Methods; Numerical deffirentiation.

Description:
Numerical differentiation is the process of finding the numerical value of a derivative of a given function at a given point.

Goal for this particular laboratory work:


Understanding the usage of deffirentiation in coding and mathematics, calculating first and second order derivatives using analytical and finite formula.

This code successfully calculates and displays:
1) Dialogue with a user to obtain both left and right borders of the interval on the x-axis.
2) Dialogue with a user to obtain the desired presicion.
3) values of J0(x) for x between a and b 
4) values of J0'(x) for x between a and b (using analytical formula)
5) values of J0'(x) for x between a and b (using forward difference)
6) values of J0''(x) for x between a and b (using analytical formula)
7) values of J0''(x) for x between a and b (using forward difference)


With the help of WolframAlpha I found all of the necessary derivatives:

And most importantly by the help of GNUPLOTWEB I managed to present it graphically (with the derivative.dat file that I made):

By calculating the data with my code, in the interval from [0:6,28] and precision of 0.01 I found all of the points needed to do the graph.



Gnuplot output:
