According to Wolfram alpha, the are below the curve equals:

The code calculates the area using three different rules and in the interval [0;3.14], I got:

This shows that the code is valid.

In this laboratory work, I learned some new rules on how to find the area below the curve and how it could be used in the coding.


Moreover this code calculates and displays:
1) Dialogue with a user to obtain lef and right borders, as well as the desired presicion.
2) Value of are below the curve of J0(x) and x axis (using the rectangle rule).
3) Value of are below the curve of J0(x) and x axis (using the trapezoidal rule)
4) Value of are below the curve of J0(x) and x axis (using the Simpton's rule)
