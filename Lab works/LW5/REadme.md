Laboratory work #5
Numerical methods, Sorting and Statistics.
Theory:

Data sorting is any process that involves arranging the data into some meaningful order to make it easier to understand, analyze or visualize.

Statistics: 
The practice or science of collecting and analysing numerical data in large quantities, especially for the purpose of inferring proportions in a whole from those in a representative sample.

My code successfully calculates and displays:

1) Dialogue with a user to obtain a symbol string.
2) Symbol with minimal value (according to ASCII integer value).
3) Symbol with maximal value (according to ASCII integer value).
4) Average value (according to ASCII integer value).
5) Median value of the string (according to ASCII integer value).
6) Sort symbol in alphabetical order.

I had some troubles compling the code with the "finding mode". Therefore, I didn't include it in my code.
